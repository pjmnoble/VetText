This is a forum for veterinary text-miners. Whether you are using proprietary text-mining software, simpler rule based calssifications (such as regular expressions) or writing your own code to create classification algorithms or develop machine-learning models, we hope you will find some useful information both on this site and by joining in with our quarterly forums

As this site develops, we will have notifications of upcoming meetings and workshops as well as links to useful resources and, with time, an expanding repository of useful code and disctionaries to help with analysing veterinary clinical texts.
