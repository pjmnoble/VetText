Abstract for Brian Hur's talk:
eterinarians record an enormous amount of data when completing their clinical records, but the fragmentation of this data into different clinics is the first obstacle to larger, population level understanding of important veterinary problems, such as antimicrobial usage patterns and antimicrobial stewardship. Studies using VetCompass Australia and natural language processing have demonstrated antimicrobial usage patterns in companion animal practices across Australia1.  It has also highlighted the many obstacles and barriers to the task of converting raw clinical notes into a format that can be readily queried and analysed.
